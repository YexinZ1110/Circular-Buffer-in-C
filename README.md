# Circular-Buffer-in-C
Circular buffer is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end. This structure lends itself easily to buffering data streams. It can realize operations including initialization, adding, removing elements, and printing buffer contents. It has a fixed size and can handle overflow conditions.
